In this project, you will be building a database application to gather information about 
TV-Broadcasting Satellites across Asia, Europe, Atlantic and America. This include the 
carrier rockets used to put the satellites in orbit, their position, the information about the 
channels they broadcast and the corresponding networks. This will help build a tool for 
users to identify which satellites are in range for their location and what channels they 
can pick up from them.

The main site we will be using to provide such information is Lyngsat.com, Although the 
site provides a very exhaustive list about the information above, it has limited 
functionalities for filtering or doing some higher level aggregations on the different 
satellites and their broadcasted channels and networks. Hence, your application will be 
used to provide more flexibility on that front. 
Your task will to build a database system backend and an application that provide the 
features described next.
